# Matrix multiplication library
Basic (not that) high-performing matrix multiplication library

| Files | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Makefile | "nuff said" |
| Doxyfile | Doxygen configuration file for generating documentation |
| matrix.hpp | The library code. All included in the header as it was flagged to be OK |
| matrix_test.cpp | Module-test code and executable is created from this |
| matrix_gen.py | Python script for generating valid test vectors for matrices |
| test_vectors.hpp | Test-vectors generated by matrix_gen.py Python script |

# How to make the assets:
**make matrix_test** compiles just the test executable
**make all** builds both the executable and the documentation (assumes that you have Doxygen installed to your system path)

**python3 matrix_gen.py > test_vectors.hpp** is used to generate new test-vectors.


This work has been tested with 64-bit Cygwin environment as well as in Raspberry Pi.
